# Java Classes and Objects Problems for Beginners

## Problem 1: Create a Simple Class

-    **Objective**: Create a class named `Car` with the following attributes:
     -    `String model`
     -    `String color`
     -    `int year`
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class, set its attributes, and
     print them.

## Problem 2: Create a Method

-    **Objective**: Add a method named `startEngine` to the `Car` class that
     prints "The engine is started".
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class and call the `startEngine`
     method.

## Problem 3: Constructor Usage

-    **Objective**: Add a constructor to the `Car` class that takes `model`,
     `color`, and `year` as parameters and sets them for the object.
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class using the constructor and
     print the attributes.

## Problem 4: Getters and Setters

-    **Objective**: Add getter and setter methods for the `model` attribute in
     the `Car` class.
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class, set the model using the
     setter, and get the model using the getter to print it.

## Problem 5: Default Constructor

-    **Objective**: Add a default constructor to the `Car` class that sets
     default values for `model`, `color`, and `year`.
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class using the default constructor
     and print the attributes.

## Problem 6: Multiple Objects

-    **Objective**: Create multiple objects of the `Car` class with different
     attribute values.
-    **Task**: Print the attributes of each object to demonstrate how they hold
     different values.

## Problem 7: Class with Behavior

-    **Objective**: Add a method named `accelerate` in the `Car` class that
     takes an `int` speed as a parameter and prints "The car accelerates to X
     km/h".
-    **Task**: Create an object of the `Car` class and call the `accelerate`
     method with different speed values.

## Problem 8: Object Interaction

-    **Objective**: Create another class named `Driver` with an attribute `name`
     and a method `driveCar(Car car)` that prints the driver's name and the
     car's model.
-    **Task**: Create objects of both `Driver` and `Car` classes, and call
     `driveCar` method.

## Problem 9: Static Members

-    **Objective**: Add a static attribute `totalCars` in the `Car` class that
     keeps track of the number of `Car` objects created.
-    **Task**: Update this attribute in the constructor and print the total
     number of cars created after creating several `Car` objects.

## Problem 10: Copy Constructor

-    **Objective**: Add a copy constructor to the `Car` class that creates a new
     object as a copy of an existing object.
-    **Task**: Create a `Car` object, use the copy constructor to create another
     object, and print the attributes of both objects to verify they have the
     same values.
