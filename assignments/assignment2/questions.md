1. Design a calculator using if else ladder.
2. Design a calculator using switch case.
3. Find out greatest of 3 numbers using only if-else.
4. John is a person who is studying MCA. He follows a specific weekly routine.
   i.e. If it is Saturday or Sunday, he spends his day by `Playing Games`. From
   Monday to Friday each alternating day he does `Competitive Coding` and
   `Making Projects` respectively.

     Write a java program which has a day variable storing any integer, And for
     valid day number it should display appropriate work.

     - Solve it using switch case but condition is there will be maximum 3
       `case` keywords. If there are more than 3 `case` is used, Answer becomes
       invalid.
     - The days are staring from `Sunday` and the value for `Sunday` is `0`.
     - There will be no output for invalid days.
