# Mini Projects

1. **Simple Calculator**

     - Create a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic
       operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use
       loops to keep the calculator running until the user decides to exit.
       Implement operations using conditional statements and arithmetic
       operators. Include input validation to handle cases like division by
       zero.

2. **Temperature Converter**

     - Develop a command-line program that converts temperatures between
       Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs the temperature and
       selects the conversion type. Use conditional statements for the
       conversion logic. Solve this with basic input/output handling and
       mathematical operations.

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

     - Build a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game for the command line. Use a 2D array
       to represent the game board and loops to alternate turns between players.
       Check for a winner after each move using loops and conditional
       statements, and display the final result.

4. **Number Guessing Game**

     - Create a game where the computer selects a random number within a range,
       and the player guesses it. Use loops to allow multiple guesses and
       conditional statements to provide feedback like "too high" or "too low."
       Track the number of attempts and display the result when the correct
       number is guessed.

5. **Word Counter**

     - Write a command-line program that counts words, characters, and sentences
       in a string. Achieve this using loops and string manipulation methods
       like `length()` and `charAt()`. Find the longest word and most frequent
       word using arrays and loops.

6. **Array Statistics**

     - Generate an array of random integers and calculate statistics like mean,
       median, mode, and range. Use loops to iterate through the array and
       conditional statements to compute the statistics. This project focuses on
       array manipulation and basic mathematical calculations.

7. **Pattern Printing**

     - Create a program that prints various patterns (e.g., triangles, pyramids,
       diamonds) using loops. The user selects the pattern type and number of
       rows. Practice nested loops and conditional logic to control the program
       flow.

8. **Simple Voting System**

     - Implement a voting system where users vote for their favorite option from
       a list. Use arrays or lists to store the options and the number of votes.
       After voting ends, display the total votes for each option. This project
       involves basic input/output handling and array manipulation.

9. **Prime Number Checker**

     - Create a command-line program that checks if a number is prime. The
       program repeatedly asks for user input and uses a loop to check
       divisibility by numbers less than the input. Use loops and conditional
       statements to determine and display whether the number is prime.

10. **Simple Stopwatch**
     - Develop a command-line stopwatch that the user can start, stop, and
       reset. Use loops to continuously update the time and conditional
       statements to handle user input. Implement basic time manipulation and
       loops to achieve functionality.
